This is like [nvalt][1], except:

- It runs from the terminal
- It should run on any system that python works on(hopefully)

If you feel like contributing and are looking for ideas on what to help with, take a look at the todo.taskpaper document(if it exists), it will contain everything that I think needs to be implemented.
If you have an idea for something else, great, go ahead and do it.
